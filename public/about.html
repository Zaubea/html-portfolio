<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Zaubea Aieni; I am 26 years old, and I reside in Kolkata, India.I am a newcomer to the field of programming. I discovered my enthusiasm for coding and learning about new trends later in life, but once I became interested in it, there was no turning back. I aspire to be an effective full-stack web developer, and I am always working toward that objective.Painting, reading novels, watching thriller movies, and attempting to keep up with fashion and skincare trends are some of my hobbies. I am an introvert with hypersensitivity, yet I am a fantastic conversationalist.Yay!! In a nutshell, that's all there is to know about me. I'll keep you posted on all the new trends that emerge in the future.
